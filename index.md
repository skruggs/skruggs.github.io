### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
    Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs because I enjoy doing madlibs, so it was fun figuring out how to create a madlib paragraph with code. I was able to write code that allows for user input so that a new story is made for whoever runs the program. Also, I worked with string variables and learned how to initialize them so that the user is able to input any word they like.

* Lab 4
    Lab 4 parts 1 and 2 was another lab I enjoyed doing because I was able to show the range in which can be used; to create programs that act as a useful and tool and as a fun game to play. In part 1, I worked with functions that allowed the user to input any number of their choice and convert that number to tsp, tbsp, oz, or cups. In part 2, I used code to make a two-player number guessing game dependent on user input so that the game is different everytime time it is played.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8 parts 1 and 2 is another lab where I was able to learn about how diverse code can be. Part 1 of the lab I worked with a function that would search through a vector of numbers in order to find the highest and lowest number. It would then take out those two numbers and calculate the average of the remaining numbers so it would not be skwewed by outliers. In part 2, I got to work with nested loops to display a pattern consisting of keyboard symbols.
